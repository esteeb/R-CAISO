This project attempts to answer three primary questions:
  1. Did the lockdowns and shift to working from home affect the shape of the CA duck curve?
     1.a. How? Better or worse?
  2. Did the lockdowns and shift to working from home change the shape of morning load? 
  3. Did the lockdowns and shift to working from home change emissions from the CA grid?
  
  
  
The CAISO interface offers the ability to download CSVs of information in five minute intervals - but only back to 10 April 2018 (but the first two days have some weird formatting problems, so really only back to 12 April 2018). This complicates things a little bit. Fortunately, though, we can compare several normal months to the same month the following year. 

For example:
--- 
Original Month: May 2018
Comparison Month: May 2019
---

This works with May 2018 to February 2019
