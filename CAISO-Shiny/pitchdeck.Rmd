## CAISO Net Demand Data
- This app shows the 7-day average net demand on the CAISO grid during three consecutive years, 2018, 2019, and 2020.
- The app also indicates the mean of the max ramp rate of net demand in that 7-day window, as well as when that ramp occurs.


## Applications

- The app gives users an idea of the effects of COVID-19 related lockdowns on net demand on the California electric grid from April to July. 

## Example Plot

```{r plot}
pp <- readPNG("Plot1.png")
plot.new() 
rasterImage(pp,0,0,1,1)

```

## Future Development

I aim to further asses impacts on overall demand and CO2 emissions as well.
